HOW TO BUILD
~~Have the lwjgl jar files in the lib/ folder, and any needed native libraries (.dll, .so, etc.) in native/.
To build, use the commmand
    javac -cp .:lib/* *.java 

To run/test, use the command
   java -cp .:lib/* -Djava.library.path=native/linux George

If you have the library files elsewhere, modify the commands as needed.


MORE NOTES

FIRST NOTE: Any of these things can be completely ignored. Some of it SHOULD be completely ignored.
It's just brainstorming!

Resemblances:
-Warioland 3! (Attain new abilities, use them to resurvey levels and get new stuff)
-Assassin's Creed! (There's a central supervillain (with minions?) that travels through time)
	-He has portals in different places, messing up stuff in history (Ghengis Khan, Atilla,
					Billy The Kid, Jack the Ripper, Stalin, Dracula
					Elizabeth Bathry)
			-possibly portals to save people too- Elvis? 
	-(We need to do some research/ keep eyes open for fun historical people to kill or help.)
-Braid! (Time trvel abilities)
-Kingdom Hearts! (different worlds or portals for time) (Gives us neat opportunities
-Captain America ( punching pseudo Hitler = final level)

Open up new time portals to complete new missions/ chase the central bad guy
-pick up new abilities on the way

future stuff too maybe

zombies, trees, baby hitler




Attacks:
Jump like mario?
Or Weapon sets that get better?
Or weapons you pick up with time, like a lightsaber in the future level(s)?~~
